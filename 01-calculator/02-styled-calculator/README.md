In this iteration we will be adding stlying to our calculator to make it more user friendly.
I will be using bootstrap, bootstrap is a bunch of premade css components and classes.

You are free to use what ever you are most comfortable with.

1. how should the buttons be arranged?
2. should this be responsive?
3. whats the best way to display the current math problem and answer?
4. should my files be orginised different?
