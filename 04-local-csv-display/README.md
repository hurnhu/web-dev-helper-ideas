**This one can be a bit of a challenge, ive added hints and starter js.

This isnt the only way to handle this. If you can think of another way try it out and ignore the starter js!**

Things you must google/know for this one
1. file reader
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
https://javascript.info/file

2. local storage

3. html element input of type file

4. bulma - the CSS framework

I want to make an application that i can upload a csv file and have it render to the webpage.

I would also like to save the contents of the csv to local storage

When the page loads i should be presented with 2 options.

1. upload a new csv
2. display a csv that was already uploaded.
